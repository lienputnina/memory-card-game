# Project plan

## About

This is be a memory card game. The user flips cards to find a matching pair.

### Finishing touches

- Add "flip" animation
- Change tab icon
- **Host on Netlify or Vercel!**

## Disclaimer

Used ChatGPT to:

- remind of the syntax for Front-end technologies and array manipulations in JavaScript
- Summarize the methods for image comparison from Stack-Overflow and provide a more modern and streamlined approach (?)
